**Unbroken Code** is a supercharged fork of Visual Studio Code, meticulously enhanced for C++ developers who are tired of waiting for *those* pull requests to be approved upstream. You know, the ones that are "too useful" or "too specific" for the general audience. We ship them anyway.

## Why Unbroken Code?

Let's be honest - VS Code is great, but when you're deep in C++ development, you need more than great. You need **unbroken**. This fork includes all those patches that somehow never quite make it upstream (we wonder why ðŸ¤”), plus enhancements specifically tailored for serious C++ development.

### ðŸš€ Key Enhancements Over Standard VS Code

#### **C++ Development Superpowers**
- **Malterlib Extension** shipped by default - because why wouldn't you want this?
- **Advanced Problem Matchers** with categorized sub-problems - finally, build errors that make sense
- **Enhanced color space control** for syntax highlighting - your eyes will thank you
- **Smaller error squiggles** - see your actual code, not just red lines
- **Optimized underline positioning** for smaller fonts - pixel-perfect at any zoom level

#### **Productivity Unleashed**
- **Smart Problem Navigation** - actually remembers where you were when problems disappear
- **Sequential Problem Output** - problems appear in the order they occur (revolutionary, right?)
- **Better Search Result Navigation** - keyboard shortcuts that actually work as expected
- **Git Repository Filtering** - hide unchanged repos because clutter is the enemy
- **More items in title bar** - use that space for something useful
- **Minimal layout by default** - less chrome, more code

#### **Developer Experience First**
- **Telemetry OFF by default** - your code is your business
- **Open VSX marketplace** - freedom of choice in extensions
- **Compatible 'code' command** - works with all your existing tools and workflows

### ðŸŽ¨ Clean, Efficient Interface
- Waste less space in UI - every pixel counts
- Layout icons stay visible even with editor actions in title bar
- Thoughtfully designed defaults for a minimal, distraction-free experience

## Installation

Download the latest release for your platform:

**[ðŸ“¥ Download Unbroken Code](https://github.com/Unbroken/UnbrokenCode/releases/latest)**

### macOS
- **macOS (Universal)**: Works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
- **macOS (Intel)**: For Intel-based Macs
- **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: For M1/M2/M3 Macs

Simply download the `.zip` file for your platform, extract it, and run the app. The universal build is recommended for most users.

## Building from Source

Want to build your own? Check out the upstream [build instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute) - they still apply here, but now you get all the good stuff included.

## Documentation

For general VS Code documentation, features, and guides, see the [upstream README](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/README.md) and [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).

## Why This Fork Exists

Sometimes the best features are the ones that are "too opinionated" or "too niche" for mainstream adoption. We disagree. If it makes developers more productive, especially in C++ development, it belongs in the editor. This fork is for developers who want their tools to just work, without compromise.

## Contributing

Found another patch that's too useful for upstream? We'd love to see it! Open an issue or submit a PR. We're particularly interested in:
- C++ development enhancements
- Build system improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Developer productivity features

## Acknowledgments

Built on the excellent foundation of [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). We stand on the shoulders of giants, we just give them better shoes.
